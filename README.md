## Introduction

The Animal Detector project is dedicated to identifying animals from images using machine learning techniques. This project leverages a powerful set of libraries and tools to perform in-depth analysis and accurate predictions of animal classifications.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Pandas

### Data Exploration

The dataset comprises 300 images, each with a shape of (512, 512, 3). These images are scaled to values between 0 and 1 to facilitate processing and analysis.

## Model Building

Convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to achieve accurate classification of images into cat, dog, or fox categories. The model incorporates multiple convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and dense layers.

### Training and Testing

The dataset is thoughtfully split into training and testing sets. The model undergoes intensive training on the training set, followed by rigorous evaluation on the testing set to assess its performance.

## Conclusion

It serves as a valuable resource for assessing model performance and achieving accurate animal classification. The model reached close to 100% accuracy on the training dataset and high accuracy on the validation dataset, indicating that it has properly learned the features of the images and can generalize well to unseen data.
